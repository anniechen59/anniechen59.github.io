        Projects:

                1. 3D Rotation-Aware Greedy Packing (Python, VTK, LiDAR, Mask R-CNN)--2024:
                    Designed rotation-aware greedy algorithm, improving 3D object placement efficiency by ~20%.
                    Integrated Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation and LiDAR 3D models, enabling automated space optimization.
                    Implemented collision detection and VTK visualization for interactive 3D placement display.

                    >


                2. Dining-Based Social Platform (SQL, PHP, HTML, JavaScript)--2022:
                    Designed and implemented a scalable SQL backend for user profiles and reservations, optimizing query performance.
                    Built a responsive front-end and intuitive UI to support safe social meetups at partner restaurants.
                    Developed independently from database schema to UI, demonstrating full-stack development capability.
